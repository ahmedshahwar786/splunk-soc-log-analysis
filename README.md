# Splunk Enterprise Log Analysis & SOC Monitoring

## Overview
This project demonstrates a full SOC-style security monitoring workflow using **Splunk Enterprise**.  
The goal was to ingest, analyze, and correlate security logs to detect suspicious activity, generate alerts, and support incident response decisions.

The project simulates the role of a **Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst** working with centralized logs in an enterprise environment.

---

## Objectives
- Ingest and normalize logs into Splunk
- Perform security-focused log analysis
- Build dashboards and visualizations
- Detect suspicious and malicious activity
- Create alerts for security events
- Document findings in a professional SOC report

---

## Environment & Tools
- **Splunk Enterprise**
- Windows and Linux log sources
- Simulated enterprise security events
- SOC-style investigation methodology

---

## Data Sources Analyzed
- Windows security and system logs
- Authentication and access logs
- Application and service logs
- Network and system activity logs

---

## Analysis Performed

### Log Ingestion & Parsing
- Configured Splunk inputs and indexes
- Parsed and normalized log fields
- Validated data integrity and timestamps

### Security Use Cases
- Failed login detection
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Suspicious process execution
- Abnormal authentication patterns
- Event correlation across log sources

### Dashboards & Visualizations
- Authentication activity overview
- Security event trends
- System and user behavior analysis
- Incident investigation views

### Alerts
- Threshold-based alerts for suspicious activity
- Correlated alerts for multi-event detection
- SOC-style alert tuning to reduce false positives

---

## Findings & Insights
- Identified abnormal login patterns
- Detected policy and configuration changes
- Observed indicators of potential malicious activity
- Demonstrated effective use of Splunk for SOC monitoring
